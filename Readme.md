# Portfolio Frontend Project Udacity

## Description

This repo contains my frontend project for the Udacity Full Stack Developer Nano Degree. The project is adapted from the design brief and customized with own images and copy.

## Usage

The project contains an app and dist folder. The app folder contains the original files. To create the dist folder one needs to run 
* npm install 
* gulp

The gulp task will copy all assets, minify and make images responsive.

## Credits

I used the Skeleton framework as a grid based layout. I also used various Gulp tasks to help in the dist pipeline. Fontello was used for creating social media icons.

Enjoy!
